Test folder

This folder should contain unitary tests which will allow everyone to have a look at what have been done.
Please make only one file per test (even if you aren't compelled to do, it will be clearer) and complete the makefile adding the test.
Please put your additional inputs (test.csv and train.csv are in the parent_folder/data folder) in the folder input and redirect output to the same name folder (output).
